      	<h2 style="color:#0275d8;">My Story</h2>
      	<hr class="my-4">

      	<h5>Ever since I was a little kid, problem-solving has been my passion. I recall being in front of the very basic intel dual-core PC, with a box like giant monitor, making it print “ Hello, World” for the very first time on Turbo C. As I went through few coding books, it was out of the world experience to make the computer do whatever I imagined. <br><br>

The internet was evolving, and everyone wanted a web presence, and so do I. It led me to start experimenting with HTML and CSS. This resulted in building creative web pages to convey meaningful information. Growing internet use demands data-intensive applications and very reliable system designs. I quickly adapted myself to these changes and shifted my learning curve towards the JAVA and Python. This passion carried me through my own startup named infobird.in, I helped small scale emerging businesses with their software needs. Here, I had an exposure to learn and discover new technologies and tools. I learned new languages, algorithms, tools, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me a kid. And it was here that I knew I could add a lot more value to everyone’s life by just sitting in front of a computer. <br><br>

Indeed, this passion will remain forever, and there is still much to be discovered and yet more problems to be solved.</h5>
